This directory is automatically populated by gen-package-version with packageVersion.d at compile time.
To ensure Git creates this directory, this text file is needed.
Ideally, we wouldn't need this directory at all and just generate the file in the /source directory.
This doesn't work unfortunately because gen-package-version always assumes a package directory.
